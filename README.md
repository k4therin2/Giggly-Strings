# Giggly-Strings
A virtual reality so amazing you'll never want to leave.

This is a side-project mostly worked on by me ([k4therin2](www.github.com/k4therin2)) and Haley ([hne3](www.github.com/hne3)) to explore Google Cardboard.
General idea: visualize music in VR.

# Giggle the Strings
  1. Make sure you have the [latest version of unity] (http://unity3d.com/unity/download)
  2. It would probably help if you had a [Google Cardboard] (https://cardboard.withgoogle.com/)
  3. Make sure you have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=i) on your machine (you don't need studio- just the SDK). REMEMBER where you put this!
  4. `git clone https://github.com/k4therin2/Giggly-Strings.git` into your fav folder
  5. In Unity: 
       * File -> Build Settings -> Add Current
       * Select "Android"
       * Select "Build and Run"
       * Enter your Android SDK location when prompted
  6. Profit
  
So what can you do to help?
 * We'd like to have a launch screen/menu
 * We'd like to have different scenes for different songs
 * We'd EVENTUALLY like to be able to use the Spotify API to generate visualizations for different sounds
 * But now we're just having fun and you should too
